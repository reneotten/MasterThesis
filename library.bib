@article{Gullans2010,
abstract = {We theoretically investigate the controlled dynamic polarization of lattice nuclear spins in GaAs double quantum dots containing two electrons. Three regimes of long-term dynamics are identified, including the buildup of a large difference in the Overhauser fields across the dots, the saturation of the nuclear polarization process associated with formation of so-called "dark states", and the elimination of the difference field. We show that in the case of unequal dots, buildup of difference fields generally accompanies the nuclear polarization process, whereas for nearly identical dots, buildup of difference fields competes with polarization saturation in dark states. The elimination of the difference field does not, in general, correspond to a stable steady state of the polarization process.},

abstract = {Spin-Qubits as elementary building blocks of a quantum computer promise scalability due to the use of fabrication methods of the semiconductor industry. In this thesis a way of calculating an optimal set of voltages is presented based on tunnel coupling and the WKB approximation. A couple of constraints prevent the creation of undesired electron baths as well as tunneling off the dot in a certain direction. Furthermore, different layouts are optimized and compared to each other using appropriate quality factors, like the voltages needed to change this tunnel coupling or the independent tunability of the desired parameters. As a result, a new proposal for the Standard Delft Layout with different gate lengths is created. On top of that, a scalable layout is optimized which promises the best properties regarding the quality factors.},

abstract = {Like modern microprocessors today, future processors of quantum information may be implemented using all-electrical control of silicon-based devices. A semiconductor spin qubit may be controlled without the use of magnetic fields by using three electrons in three tunnel-coupled quantum dots. Triple dots have previously been implemented in GaAs, but this material suffers from intrinsic nuclear magnetic noise. Reduction of this noise is possible by fabricating devices using isotopically purified silicon. We demonstrate universal coherent control of a triple-quantum-dot qubit implemented in an isotopically enhanced Si/SiGe heterostructure. Composite pulses are used to implement spin-echo type sequences, and differential charge sensing enables single-shot state readout. These experiments demonstrate sufficient control with sufficiently low noise to enable the long pulse sequences required for exchange-only two-qubit logic and randomized benchmarking.},

abstract = {One fundamental requirement for quantum computation is to perform universal manipulations of quantum bits at rates much faster than the qubit's rate of decoherence. Recently, fast gate operations have been demonstrated in logical spin qubits composed of two electron spins where the rapid exchange of the two electrons permits electrically controllable rotations around one axis of the qubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations around at least two axes. Here we show that by subjecting each electron spin to a magnetic field of different magnitude we achieve full quantum control of the two-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single device, a magnetic field gradient of several hundred milliTesla is generated and sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As nuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using quantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single and potentially multiple qubit operations with gate times that approach the threshold required for quantum error correction.},

Recently, an alternative to the well-established charge detection via on-chip electrometers has emerged, based on in situ gate detectors and radio-frequency dispersive readout techniques. This approach promises to facilitate scalability by removing the need for additional device components devoted to sensing. Here, we perform gate-based dispersive readout of an accumulation-mode silicon quantum dot. We observe that the sensitivity of an accumulation-mode gate detector is significantly affected by its bias voltage, particularly if this exceeds the threshold for electron accumulation. We discuss these results in light of the competing capacitive contributions to the dispersive response, and propose a device layout to enable gate-based readout for scaled-up arrays of accumulation-mode quantum dots.},

However, investigating the QPT physics in a conventional condensed matter setup is limited by inadequacy in experimental control. Artificial atoms, such as superconducting qubits that can be individually manipulated, provide a new paradigm of realizing and exploring QPTs by building an on-chip quantum simulator. Here we demonstrate an experiment of simulating the quantum critical behaviour in a highly-controllable solid-state circuit, consisting of four qubits weakly coupled to a common resonator mode. By off-resonantly driving the system to renormalize the critical spin-field coupling strength, we have observed the normal-to-superradiant QPT, in excellent agreement with the driven Tavis-Cummings theory. Our achievement of a QPT with a low spin-field coupling offers new experimental approaches towards exploring QPT related science in the thermodynamic limit, such as scaling behaviour, parity breaking and long-range quantum correlations.},

By simultaneously measuring their dispersive response, we obtain the complete charge stability diagram of the device. Charge transitions between the two quantum dots and between each quantum dot and either the source or the drain contact are detected through phase shifts in the reflected radio-frequency signals. At finite bias, reflectometry allows probing charge transitions to excited quantum-dot states thereby enabling direct access to the energy level spectra of the quantum dots. Interestingly, we find that in the presence of charge transport across the two dots the reflectometry signatures of interdot transitions display a dip-peak structure containing quantitative information on the charge relaxation rates in the double quantum dot.},

Isotopic purification, and the resulting seconds-long quantum coherence times, have recently put Si at the forefront of efforts to create a solid state quantum processor. Here we demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling, and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.},

abstract = {High fidelity gate operations for manipulating individual and multiple qubits in the presence of decoherence are a prerequisite for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the control methods used in earlier experiments on semiconductor two-electron spin qubits are based on unrealistic approximations which preclude reaching the required fi- delities. An attractive remedy is to use control pulses found in numer- ical simulations that minimize the infidelity from decoherence and take the experimentally important imperfections and constraints into account. Using this approach and experimentally determined noise spectra, I find pulses for singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs double quantum dots with fi- delities as high as 99.9{\%}. Fully eliminating systematic pulse errors will likely require a calibration of the pulses on the experiment using some form of self-consistent approach. Starting with inaccurate control pulses I numerically show that elimination of individual systematic gate errors is possible by applying a modification of the bootstrap protocol proposed by Dobrovitski et al. [1] while still retaining the pulses' high fidelities},

abstract = {Information processing using quantum systems provides new paradigms for computation and communication and may yield insights into our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics. However, realistic systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment, hence all quantum operations are subject to errors. Realization of a physical system for processing of quantum information that is tolerant of errors is a fundamental problem in quantum science and engineering. Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins by extending the Loss–DiVincenzo scheme and by combining actively protected quantum memory and long-distance coupling mechanisms. Our approach is based on a demonstrated encoding of qubits in long-lived two-electron states, which immunizes qubits against the dominant error from hyperfine interactions. We develop a universal set of quantum gates compatible with active error suppression for these encoded qubits and an effective long-range interaction between the qubits by controlled electron transport. This approach yields a scalable architecture with favourable error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation, consistent with present experimental parameters.},

Finally, the physics of the relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms is reviewed and experimental results are compared with theories for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions.

abstract = {A simple, rigorous geometrical representation for the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is developed to describe the behavior of an ensemble of two quantum‐level, noninteracting systems which are under the influence of a perturbation. In this case the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation may be written, after a suitable transformation, in the form of the real three‐dimensional vector equation dr∕dt=$\omega$×r, where the components of the vector r uniquely determine $\psi$ of a given system and the components of $\omega$ represent the perturbation. When magnetic interaction with a spin ☒ system is under consideration, ``r'' space reduces to physical space. By analogy the techniques developed for analyzing the magnetic resonance precession model can be adapted for use in any two‐level problems. The quantum‐mechanical behavior of the state of a system under various different conditions is easily visualized by simply observing how r varies under the action of different types of $\omega$. Such a picture can be used to advantage in analyzing various MASER‐type devices such as amplifiers and oscillators. In the two illustrative examples given (the beam‐type MASER and radiation damping) the application of the picture in determining the effect of the perturbing field on the molecules is shown and its interpretation for use in the complex Maxwell's equations to determine the reaction of the molecules back on the field is given. {\textcopyright} 1957 The American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Two level systems that can be reliably controlled and measured hold promise as qubits both for metrology and for quantum information science. Since a fluctuating environment limits the performance of qubits in both capacities, understanding environmental coupling and dynamics is key to improving qubit performance. We show measurements of the level splitting and dephasing due to the voltage noise of a GaAs singlet-triplet qubit during exchange oscillations. Unexpectedly, the voltage fluctuations are non-Markovian even at high frequencies and exhibit a strong temperature dependence. This finding has impacts beyond singlet-triplet qubits since nearly all solid state qubits suffer from some kind of charge noise. The magnitude of the fluctuations allows the qubit to be used as a charge sensor with a sensitivity of 2×10-8e/√Hz, 2 orders of magnitude better than a quantum-limited rf single electron transistor. Based on these measurements, we provide recommendations for improving qubit coherence, allowing for higher fidelity operations and improved charge sensitivity.},

It leads naturally to a metric for benchmarking device performance and optimizing device designs, and provides a scheme for automating the control of gate operations and reducing their complexity. Because CODA is both experimentally and computationally efficient, it is readily exten- sible to large systems.

abstract = {Coherent interactions at a distance provide a powerful tool for quantum simulation and computation. The most common approach to realize an effective long-distance coupling 'on-chip' is to use a quantum mediator, as has been demonstrated for superconducting qubits and trapped ions. For quantum dot arrays, which combine a high degree of tunability with extremely long coherence times, the experimental demonstration of coherent spin-spin coupling via an intermediary system remains an important outstanding goal. Here, we use a linear triple-quantum-dot array to demonstrate a first working example of a coherent interaction between two distant spins via a quantum mediator. The two outer dots are occupied with a single electron spin each and the spins experience a superexchange interaction through the empty middle dot which acts as mediator. Using single-shot spin read-out we measure the coherent time evolution of the spin states on the outer dots and observe a characteristic dependence of the exchange frequency as a function of the detuning between the middle and outer dots. This approach may provide a new route for scaling up spin qubit circuits using quantum dots and aid in the simulation of materials and molecules with non-nearest neighbour couplings such as MnO, high-temperature superconductors and DNA. The same superexchange concept can also be applied in cold atom experiments.},

@article{Bluhm2011,
abstract = {Qubits, the quantum mechanical bits required for quantum computing, must retain their fragile quantum states over long periods of time. In many types of electron spin qubits, the primary source of decoherence is the interaction between the electron spins and nuclear spins of the host lattice. For electrons in gate defined GaAs quantum dots, previous spin echo measurements have revealed coherence times of about 1 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}s at low magnetic fields below 100 mT. Here, we show that coherence in such devices can actually survive to much longer times, and provide a detailed understanding of the measured nuclear spin induced decoherence. At fields above a few hundred millitesla, the coherence time measured using a single-pulse spin echo extends to 30 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}s. At lower magnetic fields, the echo first collapses, but then revives at later times given by the period of the relative Larmor precession of different nuclear species. This behavior was recently predicted, and as we show can be quantitatively accounted for by a semi-classical model for the electron spin dynamics in the presence of a nuclear spin bath. Using a multiple-pulse Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo sequence, the decoherence time can be extended to more than 200 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}s, which represents an improvement by two orders of magnitude compared to previous measurements. This demonstration of effective methods to mitigate nuclear spin induced decoherence puts the quantum error correction threshold within reach.},

abstract = {Electron spins in semiconductors are promising qubits because their long coherence times enable nearly 10{\^{}}9 coherent quantum gate operations. However, developing a scalable high-fidelity two-qubit gate remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an entangling gate between two double-quantum-dot spin qubits in GaAs by using a magnetic field gradient between the two dots in each qubit to suppress decoherence due to charge noise. When the magnetic gradient dominates the voltage-controlled exchange interaction between electrons, qubit coherence times increase by an order of magnitude. Using randomized benchmarking and self-consistent quantum measurement, state, and process tomography, we measure single-qubit gate fidelities of approximately 99{\%} and an entangling gate fidelity of 90{\%}. In the future, operating double quantum dot spin qubits with large gradients in nuclear-spin-free materials, such as Si, should enable a two-qubit gate fidelity surpassing the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.},

abstract = {Microwave resonators have been used to realize qubit readout, two-qubit gates, and state shuttling between distant quantum systems. Strong coupling between a spin qubit and a resonator may be achieved using an inhomogeneous magnetic field generated with a nanomagnet. We consider a spin qubit in a double quantum dot exposed to a stray magnetic field with transverse and longitudinal components with respect to an applied external field. We show that this geometry leads to transverse and longitudinal couplings of {\~{}}1 MHz between the spin qubit and the resonator. Using realistic simulations of a GaAs device, we show how precise placement of the nanomagnet allows to select between transverse and longitudinal coupling. We also explain how to mitigate new dephasing and relaxation channels that are inherent to this coupling scheme. This analysis gives a clear route towards realization of coherent state transfer between a microwave resonator and a single spin in quantum dots with a fidelity above 90{\%}. Improved dynamical decoupling sequences, low-noise environments, and longer-lived microwave cavities may lead to substantially higher fidelities in the near future.},

We discuss in detail two alternative schemes which have been proposed for implementing spin qubits in quantum dots. One scheme uses spin states in a single dot and the interdot exchange coupling controls interactions between unbiased dots. The other scheme employs the singlet and triplet states of a biased double dot as the two-level system making up the qubit and exchange controls the energy splitting of the levels. Exchange in these two configurations depends differently on system parameters. Our work relies on the Heitler-London approximation and the Hund-Mulliken molecular orbital method. The results we obtain enable us to investigate the sensitivity of the system to background charge fluctuations and determine the conditions under which optimal spots, at which the influence of the charge noise is minimized, may exist in Si double quantum dot structures.},

abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain interesting problems significantly faster than classical computers. To exploit the power of a quantum computation it is necessary to perform inter-qubit operations and generate entangled states. Spin qubits are a promising candidate for implement-ing a quantum processor due to their potential for scalability and miniaturization. However, their weak interactions with the environment, which leads to their long coherence times, makes inter-qubit operations challenging. We perform a controlled two-qubit operation between singlet-triplet qubits using a dynamically decoupled sequence that maintains the two-qubit coupling while decoupling each qubit from its fluctuating environment. Using state tomography we measure the full density matrix of the system and determine the concurrence and the fidelity of the generated state, providing proof of entanglement. Singlet-triplet (S-T 0) qubits, a particular realization of spin qubits[1–7], store quantum information in the joint spin state of two electrons[8–10]. The basis states for the S-T 0 qubit can be constructed from the eigenstates of a single electron spin, | ↑〉 and | ↓〉. We choose |S〉 = 1 2 (| ↑↓〉 − | ↓↑〉) and |T 0 〉 = 1 2 (| ↑↓〉 + | ↓↑〉) for the logical subspace of the S-T 0 qubit because these states are insensitive to uniform fluctuations in the magnetic field. The qubit can then be described as a two level system with a representation on a Bloch sphere shown in Fig. 1a.},
