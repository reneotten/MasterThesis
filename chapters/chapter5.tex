\chapter{RF Readout Part}
\label{chap:setup}
In this chapter I will take a closer look at qubit readout via RF reflectometry measurements. \rsec{sec:RF_paper} is a draft for a paper discussiong in detail effects that various parts of a standart RF setup have. In \rsec{sec:RFcalib} I will discuss how we used this to tune our own two qubit readout circuit.
